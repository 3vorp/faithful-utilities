These are a collection of various utilities I've made to ease Faithful database management and usage.

**All utilities are stored in the [`tools/`](./tools/) folder.**

## Installing

All of these programs are written in NodeJS. First, install node from https://nodejs.org (either LTS or latest is fine).

After that's done, you can run any of these files using this command.

```bash
node your/file/path/here
```

## Configuration and Authentication

If you get a warning about missing tokens, this is because you need to use privileged endpoints that not everyone can access. Make sure there's a `tokens.json` file present in your repository folder â€” you can simply rename the provided [`tokens.example.json`](./tokens.example.json) file and add necessary authorization.
